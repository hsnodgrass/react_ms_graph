This project was pulled mostly from https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-training-reactspa, so check out that repo for more detail.

The purpose is to show correct configurations for an organization-owned React SPA that grants access to only organizational employees.

## Notable files

* *Config.js* - This is where the parameters for the Microsoft integration are.
..* `appId` is the id generated by AzureAD when registering a new app.
..* `authority` is the login endpoint for the application.
..* `scopes` refers to the API permissions granted to the app.
* *GraphService.js* - Functions that interact with GraphAPI.
* *App.js* - Holds the bulk of the app's logic. 
..* The object `userAgentApplication` uses the [MSAL](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js) library to hold the logic for authentication / authorization of a user.

## Running the demo app

A `Dockerfile` has been provided if you'd like to run the demo app.

To build the docker image, `cd` to the project directory and `docker build .`

To run the container, `docker run -p 3000:3000 -e REACT_APP_APP_ID=<app id> <image id>`

The app will now be available at `localhost:3000`
